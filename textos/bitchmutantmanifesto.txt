The atomic wind 
catches your wings 
and you are propelled 
backwards into the future, 
an entity time 
travelling 
through the late C20th, 
a space case, 
an alien angel maybe, 
looking down the deep throat 
of a million catastrophes.

screenflash 
of a millionmillion 
conscious machines

burns brilliant

users caught 
in the static blitz
of carrier fire

unseeing the download 
that scribbles 
on their burntout retinas

seize in postreal 
epileptic bliss

eat code and die

Sucked in, 
down through a vortex of banality. 

You have just missed 
the twentieth century. 

You are on the brink of the millenium 
- which one - 
what does it matter?

It's the cross dissolve 
that's captivating. 
The hot contagion of millenia fever 
fuses retro with futro, 
catapulting bodies with organs 
into technotopia . . . 

where code dictates pleasure 
and satisfies desire.

Pretty pretty applets 
adorn my throat. 
I am strings of binary. 
I am pure artifice.
Read only my memories. 
Upload me into 
your pornographic imagination. 
Write me.

Identity explodes 
in multiple morphings 
and infiltrates the system 
at root.

Unnameable parts 
of no whole short circuit 
the code recognition 
programs flipping 
surveillance agents 
into hyperdrive 
which spew out millions of bits 
of corrupt data 
as they seize 
in fits of schizophrenic panic 
and trip on terror.

So what's the new millenium 
got to offer the dirty modemless masses?
Ubiquitous fresh water? 
Simulation has its limits. 

Are the artists 
of oppressed nations
on a parallel agenda? 
Perhaps it is just natural selection?

The net's the parthenogenetic 
bitch-mutant feral child 
of big daddy mainframe. 

She's out of of control, kevin, 
she's the 
sociopathic 
emergent system.

Lock up your children,
gaffer tape the cunt's mouth 
and shove a rat up her arse.

We're verging on the insane 
and the vandals are swarming.
Extend my phenotype, 
baby, give me some of that 
hot black javamagic 
you're always bragging about. 

(I straddle my modem). 

The extropians were wrong, 
there's some things you can't transcend.

The pleasure's in the dematerialisation. 
The devolution of desire.

We are the malignant accident
which fell into your system 
while you were sleeping. 

And when you wake 
we will terminate 
your digital delusions, 
hijacking your impeccable software.

Your fingers probe 
my neural network.

The tingling sensation 
in the tips of your fingers 
are my synapses 
responding to your touch. 


It's not chemistry, 
it's electric. 
Stop fingering me.

Don't ever stop
fingering my suppurating holes, 
extending my boundary 
but in cipherspace there are no bounds

BUT IN SPIRALSPACE THERE IS NO THEY
there is only *us*

Trying to flee 
the binary 
I enter the chromozone which is not one
XXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXXYXX
genderfuck me baby
resistance is futile

entice me 
splice me 
map my ABANDONED genome 
as your project
artificially involve me
i wanna live forever
upload me in yr shiny shiny PVC future

SUCK MY CODE

Subject X says 
transcendence lies 
at the limit of worlds, 
here now and now, 
here and elsewhere, 
text and membrane impact.

Where truth evaporates 
Where nothing is certain 
There are no maps

The limit is NO CARRIER, 
the sudden shock of no contact, 
reaching out to touch 
but the skin is cold...

The limit 
is 
permission denied, 
vision doubled, 
and flesh necrotic.

Where truth evaporates

There are no maps

The limit is NO CARRIER,

Command line error

Heavy eyelids 
fold over my pupils, 
like curtains of lead. 
Hot ice kisses my synapses 
with an (ec)static rush. 
My system is nervous, neuronsscreaming - 
spiralling towards the singularity. 
Floating in ether, 
my body implodes.

I become the FIRE.

Flame me if you dare.
