Covered with the flowers,
Instantly I'd like to die
In this dream of ours!

No sky
no earth - but still
snowflakes fall

Green frog,
Is your body also
freshly painted?

Sick and feverish
Glimpse of cherry blossoms
Still shivering.

Without flowing wine
How to enjoy lovely
Cherry blossoms?

Fallen sick on a journey,
In dreams I run wildly
Over a withered moor.

No one travels
Along this way but I,
This autumn evening.

Harvest moon:
around the pond I wander
and the night is gone.

A lovely thing to see:
through the paper window's hole,
the Galaxy.

In all this cool
is the moon also sleeping?
There, in the pool?
